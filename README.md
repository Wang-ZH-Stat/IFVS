# IVFS
This is a code and experiment reproduction project for paper “IVFS: Simple and Efficient Feature Selection for High Dimensional Topology Preservation”. This is not a project from the paper authors, but a reproduction effort from the machine learning community.

Original paper: [IVFS: Simple and Efficient Feature Selection for High Dimensional Topology Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01299)

Reproduction paper: [Reproduction of IVFS algorithm for high-dimensional topology preservation feature selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12195)
